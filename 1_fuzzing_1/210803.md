## Fuzzing: Breaking Things with Random Inputs

- I developed c programs that implements Fuzzing examples in the [book](https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/Fuzzer.html#A-Simple-Fuzzer)
  
These are the list of  
1. A Simple Fuzzer 
2. `mkdtemp` 를 사용하여 random 한 이름의 dir생성 
3. multiprocessing을 통하여 인풋파일을 `bc` command 에 넣어주고 실행시키는 함수 구현

## LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine)

**LLVM** Detects these errors
- Out-of-bounds accesses to heap, stack and globals
- Use-after-free
- Use-after-return (clang flag -fsanitize-address-use-after-return=(never|runtime|always) default: runtime)
- Enable runtime with: ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_stack_use_after_return=1
- Use-after-scope (clang flag -fsanitize-address-use-after-scope)
- Double-free, invalid free
- emory leaks (experimental)

To briefly summerize, `LLVM` uses `Clang` as front-end and `Clang` seems like a resonable tool to use instead of `GCC`.  

Researchers have found [heartbleed](https://heartbleed.com/) bug by using inputing fuzzed commands and check if it's working correctly by **memory sanitizer**
